# Privacy Policy for Tilawa

This Privacy Policy describes how Tilawa ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect the following types of information:

*   **Audio Recordings:** When you use the recitation feature, we collect audio recordings of your voice. These recordings are sent to a third-party transcription service (OpenAI Whisper API) to convert your speech into text for the purpose of providing feedback on your recitation. We do not store these audio recordings on our servers after transcription.
*   **Transcription Data:** The text generated from your audio recordings is processed to detect mistakes and provide accuracy feedback. This text data is not stored on our servers in a way that is personally identifiable to you.
*   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you access and use the App, such as the features you use, the pages you view, and the time spent on the App. This data is collected anonymously and is used to improve the App's functionality and user experience.
*   **Device Information:** We may collect information about your mobile device, including the device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
*   **Analytics Data (Optional):** If you choose to enable analytics, we may collect data through third-party analytics services (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to understand user behavior and improve the App. This data is anonymized and aggregated.
*   **Error Reporting (Optional):** If you choose to enable error reporting, we may collect crash logs and error reports through third-party services (e.g., Sentry) to identify and fix bugs. These reports may contain information about your device and the state of the App at the time of the error, but we strive to minimize the collection of personal data.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   To provide and maintain the App's functionality, including the Quran recitation and memorization features.
*   To analyze and improve the App's performance, features, and user experience.
*   To detect and prevent technical issues and errors.
*   To understand user trends and preferences (anonymized and aggregated data).
*   To comply with legal obligations.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We may share your information with the following third parties:

*   **OpenAI Whisper API:** Your audio recordings are sent to the OpenAI Whisper API for transcription. OpenAI's use of your data is governed by their privacy policy. We do not control their data practices.
*   **Analytics Providers (Optional):** If enabled, anonymized usage data may be shared with analytics providers (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to help us understand how users interact with the App.
*   **Error Reporting Services (Optional):** If enabled, crash logs and error reports may be shared with error reporting services (e.g., Sentry) to help us diagnose and fix bugs.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).

**4. Data Retention**

We do not store your audio recordings on our servers. Transcription data is processed temporarily to provide feedback and is not stored in a personally identifiable manner. Usage, analytics, and error reporting data are retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.

**5. Your Choices**

*   **Microphone Access:** You can enable or disable microphone access for the App through your device settings. Disabling microphone access will prevent you from using the recitation feature.
*   **Analytics and Error Reporting:** You may have options within the App's settings to enable or disable analytics and error reporting.

**6. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

**7. Children's Privacy**

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
