# ✅ Podfile Fixed!

I've fixed the CocoaPods issues:

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ Uncommented the platform line: `platform :ios, '13.0'`
2. ✅ Removed the non-existent `RunnerTests` target
3. ✅ Added `use_modular_headers!` for better compatibility
4. ✅ Cleaned all pods and build files

## Now Try Running Again:

```bash
cd /Users/safwaan/G/Quran-App
flutter run
```

The app should build successfully now! 🎉

If you still see any errors, share them and I'll help fix them.
